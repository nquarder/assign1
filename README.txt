# README file for Assignment 1

- Research topics that are potentially interesting to me would include how leaners use multiple modes of communication to represent a concept, and how science educators influence public opinion related to climate change.

- README altered: While I'm certainly open to lots of different ideas, possible course project topics that I'm currently thinking about include comparing two approaches to teaching the concept of uniformly accelerated motion in an introductory physics course, and the impact these approaches have on promoting student use of multimodal representations during problem solving, and homework. Another area that I'm passionate about is the science of climate change, trends that exist in opinions about this topic, and the role of the science education community in shaping these opinions. While the potential exists to use data collected from my own students, there may also be opportunity to incorporate findings from prior studies, or other outside sources
